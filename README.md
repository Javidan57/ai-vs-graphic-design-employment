# The Influence of AI Growth on the Unemployment Rate of Graphic Designers

## Project Overview
This project investigates the relationship between the rise of AI technologies (such as **Midjourney**, **DALL·E**, **Canva AI**, and **ChatGPT**) and the employment trends of graphic designers.  
By analyzing data from the past decade (2015–2024), this project aims to uncover whether the growing popularity of AI-driven creative tools correlates with a decline in employment opportunities or job demand for graphic designers.

### Key Research Questions
- How strongly does the rise of AI tools (measured by search trends or adoption metrics) correlate with the decrease in employment or job postings for graphic designers?
- Is there a visible impact of AI popularity on designer salaries or wage growth?
- Can data-driven evidence support the hypothesis that AI automation is transforming the creative job market?

## Motivation
Over the last few years, tools like **Midjourney**, **DALL·E**, **Canva AI**, and **ChatGPT** have changed the way digital art and design are created.  
Many designers fear that AI-generated content may be replacing human creativity, while others see it as a way to increase efficiency and creativity.

This project aims to analyze real data to understand whether these fears are justified.  
By studying employment and AI popularity trends together, I want to explore if the creative industry is being disrupted—or just evolving—in response to AI innovations.

## Objectives
- Find out if there is a negative correlation between AI tool adoption and graphic designer employment.  
- Identify how salaries, job postings, and industry growth have changed over the last 10 years.  
- Create visualizations that clearly show the trends between AI growth and design jobs.  
- Discuss whether AI has replaced or reshaped creative work and what the data suggests about the future.
